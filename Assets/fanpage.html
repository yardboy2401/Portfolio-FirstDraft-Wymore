    <h2>Bio</h2>

    
        <p>Originally a hard-driving rocker in the vein of fellow Michigan garage rockers the 
          Rationals and Mitch Ryder, Bob Seger developed into one of the most popular heartland 
          rockers over the course of the '70s. </p>  
            
        <p>Combining the driving charge of Ryder's Detroit 
        Wheels with Stonesy garage rock and devotion to hard-edged soul and R&B, he crafted a 
        distinctively American sound. </p>
        
        <p>While he never attained the critical respect of his 
        contemporary Bruce Springsteen, Seger did develop a dedicated following through constant 
        touring with his Silver Bullet Band. </p>
    

        <p>Following several years of missed chances and lost 
        opportunities, Seger finally achieved a national audience in 1976 with the back-to-back 
        release of Live Bullet and Night Moves. After the platinum success of those albums, Seger 
        retained his popularity for the next two decades, releasing seven Top Ten, platinum-selling 
        albums in a row. </p>
